DEPLOYING
=========
Deployment to new environments (production, additonal development machines, etc.)
should be as painless as possible. To that end, we'll make an effort to document
and automate as much of the setup process as possible.

As a baseline, here are the prerequisites to running tomcookery (installation
will vary by platform and won't be elaborated upon here):

    * Python (2.5 or later, for its included SQLite)
    * Django (1.2 is current as of the start of tomcookery development)
    * PostgreSQL (for deployed sites - not required for local development)

To get tomcookery up and running from scratch (assuming you've got the
dependencies mentioned above installed), here are the steps you need to follow:

    * Grab the source from http://github.com/lhanson/tomcookery
    * Navigate into the tomcookery directory:
      $ cd tomcookery
    * Set up the local database:
      $ python manage.py syncdb
    * Create a superuser account (the above step will prompt for one, but
      here's how to create another:
      $ python manage.py createsuperuser --username=joe --email=joe@example.com
    * Start the development server:
      $ python manage.py runserver
    * See the site at http://localhost:8000
    * Log into the admin portlet at http://localhost:8000/admin
